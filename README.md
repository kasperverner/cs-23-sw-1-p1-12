# cs-23-sw-1-p1-12
A* pathfinding program for Group 12 P1

##  TODO:
  - [ ] Implement node cost calculation
      - [ ] Calculate base cost for a node
      - [ ] Calculate costs for each surface type
      - [ ] Calculate costs around a landmine
      - [ ] If user choose safest path, add costs to surface types, around bombs and block of bomb nodes
      - [ ] If user choose fastest path, add costs to surface types and block of bomb nodes
      - [ ] If user choose shortest path, block of bomb nodes
  - [ ] Implement node blocking (land mines, should block and not just be expensive)
  - [ ] Implement pathfinding visualization with colored grid
  - [ ] Make tests
