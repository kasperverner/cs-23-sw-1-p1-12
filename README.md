# Navigating minefields

## Abstract
Landmines as remnants of war pose a great threat to population in Africa as discussed in section 2.1 where it is clear that especially Angola and Zimbabwe are countries very hindered by landmines.

The landmines also creates tension and an atmosphere of fear and anxiety because there is a constant fear of someone stepping on one of them by accident, leading such a person to death or unable to work, effectively making them outcasts in their society. It also
limits access to resources considerably. There a also negative consequences for the socioeconomic situation of the countries in question as there are increased cost to healthcare, and infrastructure being very hard to develop.

At this point it is very clear that landmines are problematic for civilian populations
in Africa, so what is being done to solve the problem. The immediate thought would be
clearance of the landmines, so it was important to figure out the cost and risks thereof as
discussed in section 2.5. It is both too expensive and dangerous for the countries in Africa
to remove them, making this solution unrealistic in the foreseeable future. 

These findings lead us to the problem statement:

*How can we, with software, navigate minefields more efficiently to help the population in post-war countries safely navigate their land?*
